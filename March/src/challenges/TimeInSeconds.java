	//Notes: 
	// 1: The 'secs' variable is completely useless here and is a waste of data, although minute as its only allocated once per class.
	// 2: The loop is inefficient in the sense that it loops repeatedly until no longer possible, which for a larger number will cause inefficiency
	// ^: When discussed, it was suggested that this could be solved using modulus but not explicitly how.
	// 3: The variable names in this challenge however are mostly good except 'T'.
	// Theory: by dividing the number by 3600 firstly we get the number of hours, then we can use modulus of the same division to get the remainder.
	// ^ This process can then be conducted for minutes
